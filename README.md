# Administrator-only-DAGS-renaming
Prevents users that are not REDCap administrators from renaming DAGs

# How to Use:
1.	Enable module.
1.	After enabling module, click on DAGS on the left-hand side of the REDCap page under Applications 
1.	Here a REDCap administrator will be able to split users into designated access groups.
    * Administrators will see when they give rights to the other project users. The message under the users rights will read: 
    * External Modudles: Configuration Permissions
1.  Users will not be able to change the name of their group. Only the administrator will have that access.
